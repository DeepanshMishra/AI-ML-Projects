🤖 AI-based Mock Interview Software
🚧 Project Status: Currently Under Development 🚧

📌 Overview
AI-based Mock Interview Software is an intelligent and interactive platform designed to simulate real-life technical and behavioral interviews. Powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), this tool aims to help users—especially job seekers, students, and professionals—prepare for interviews by providing a realistic, responsive, and personalized mock interview experience.

Whether you're preparing for software engineering roles, data science interviews, or behavioral assessments, this tool will help build confidence, improve communication skills, and receive constructive feedback—all in a judgment-free environment.

🎯 Key Features (Planned & In Progress)
🗣️ Interactive AI Interviewer
Simulates a real-time interviewer that asks technical and behavioral questions using AI and NLP.

📂 Question Bank with Categories
Dynamic question selection from a categorized database: Technical (DSA, DBMS, OOP), HR, System Design, etc.

💬 Voice & Text Support
Users can interact with the AI using either voice or text input for a more immersive experience.

📈 Instant Feedback and Scoring
AI evaluates responses and provides insights on communication skills, content relevance, confidence, and clarity.

🧠 Adaptive Interviewing
The AI adapts follow-up questions based on user answers to mimic a real interview environment.

💾 Interview History
Save and review past sessions to track progress over time.

🌐 Web-Based Interface (In Progress)
User-friendly front-end interface to access and interact with the interview system.

🧰 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js / HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Planned)
Backend	Node.js / Express or Django / Flask (TBD)
AI/NLP	OpenAI GPT-4 / Speech Recognition APIs
Database	MongoDB / PostgreSQL (TBD)
Deployment	Docker / Render / Vercel / AWS (Planned)

🚀 How It Works (Planned Architecture)
User initiates a mock interview via UI (web or CLI).

The AI interviewer selects a question and presents it via text or voice.

User responds via voice or text.

AI transcribes (if voice), analyzes the response, and gives immediate feedback.

System logs the session and suggests improvements.
