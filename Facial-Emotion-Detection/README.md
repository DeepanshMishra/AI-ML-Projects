# Real-Time Face Detection with Emotion and Gender Recognition

This project uses OpenCV, DeepFace, and cvlib to detect human faces in real-time through a webcam feed and analyze their **emotion** and **gender** using pre-trained deep learning models.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Emotion and gender analysis with DeepFace
- Bounding boxes and labels over detected faces
- Easy-to-run Python script

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for image capture and display
- [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) – for facial analysis (emotion and gender)
- [cvlib](https://www.cvlib.net/) – for fast face detection
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) – backend for DeepFace

---

## 🧪 Supported Attributes

The script detects and displays:

- **Gender** (Male / Female)
- **Emotion** (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral)
